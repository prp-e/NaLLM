# NaLLM: _Not a Large Language Model_

## Small is the new big

In recent years, Large Language Models such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) or [Open Assistant](https://open-assistant.io) played a very large role in the world of AI and they literally changed the world for better but they also brought new problems to the scene as well! The main problem with ChatGPT is that _it's not open source_ and the main problem with the open source ones is that they need huge amount of money and resources in order to be self-hosted. So what is our possible solution?

The solution is to get back to the old ways of making a question-answering chatbot, but instead of making them on a limited knowledge base, use ChatGPT and other sources in order to make the answers more _humanized_. For this particular purpose we can use _Tensorflow_ and even better we can use [neuralintents](https://github.com/neuralnine/neuralintents) library which is written on top of tensorflow for making intelligent chatbots.
